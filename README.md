## TelecomsXChange Carrier Relations Automation Scripts

These Python scripts automate various tasks in the management of telecom services using the TelecomsXChange API. They replace typically manual, time-consuming processes with streamlined, efficient approaches.

### Few example scripts

1. **Automated Searching and Purchasing (automate_carrier_relations.py):** This script automates the process of searching for and purchasing voice routes.
    - Features
        - üîç Automated Searching: Utilizing TelecomsXChange's Market View API, the script automatically searches for the best routes based on price and quality.
        - ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Purchasing: Once optimal routes are identified, the script uses the Interconnect API to establish connections with these routes.
        - üìà Detailed Logging: All actions and responses are logged in real-time, allowing for easy tracking, debugging, and analysis.

2. **Automated Trouble Ticketing (automate_lowqos_tt.py):** This script automates the detection and escalation of low QoS calls to carriers responsible for terminating the calls.
    - Features
        - üö´ Automated Call Quality Detection: The script checks the call history from the TelecomsXChange API and identifies calls with low quality based on certain disconnect reasons.
        - üì® Automated Trouble Ticketing: The script sends a message to the respective vendor via the TelecomsXChange messaging API, automatically escalating the issue.
        - üéü Unique Trouble Ticket IDs: Each message sent has a unique ticket ID to differentiate between different issues.
        - ‚è∞ Real-time Operation: The script is designed to run in real time, checking the past 30 minutes for any low-quality calls.

3. **Automated Virtual Numbers Selling (automate_numbers_selling.py):** This script automates the process of selling DID numbers on TelecomsXChange platform, and then sends a message to the buyers informing them of the new numbers listed for sale.
    - Features
        - üì≤ Automated Listing: The script lists new DID numbers on the TelecomsXChange platform for sale.
        - üì§ Automated Messaging: Once the DID numbers are listed, the script sends a message to all the buyers notifying them about the new numbers for sale.
        - üéà Detailed Logging: All actions and responses are logged in real-time, allowing for easy tracking, debugging, and analysis.
